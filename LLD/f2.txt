 --> Object class is actually a base class of all classes in java

 whyy does arylist,linkedlist and hashmap print their data when we do syso but our class doesn't ?

Design Patterns
        ->Adaptor
        ->Singleton
        ->Observor
        ->Decorator

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.Adaptor Design Pattern
        ->there is  already existing data provider
        -> but the format in which data provider provides data is different from the format in which data consumer expects data
        -> We have to write an adaptor which converts between the two formats
        --> consumer will depend on adaptor 
        -> adaptor will call the provider and get data in format
        -> Adaptor will convert the data format from format1 to format2
        ->Consumer will get data in format2 from the adaptor

        ----Real Life usage-----
        ->Let say we want weather API daa and we found a weather API
        -> Our code s expecting data in JSON format
        -> weather API is running data in XML format
        -> we will have to write an adaptor on the API. The adaptor will call API and get data in XML format and convert it to JSON for use by our code
